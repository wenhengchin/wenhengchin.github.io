	 				<p>Digital/Content Strategy Direction, Social Media Management, and Email Marketing</p><br>

	 				<li>About Eurotherm by Schneider Electric</li>

	 				<p>Eurotherm is a supplier of machine automation products in specialist industries such as pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, etc. They support customers as a ‘trusted advisor’ with specialist knowledge and experience to achieve process excellence through machine automation efficiency and regulatory compliance. To help increase both brand awareness and perceptions online as a ‘trusted advisor’, Eurotherm launched an effort to improve their digital customer experience through content marketing. </p><br>
	 				
	 				<li>The Challenge</li>

	 				
	 				<p>Eurotherm on-boarded Heng as a full time employee to help them in this effort. To increase engagement with customers and attract potential new customers, they needed to improve upon content across articles and marketing collateral. The company was challenged with not having dedicated content writers or experienced application engineers to write about application solutions. This meant they needed to engage the services of outside content creators/writers to write meaningful material that would resonate with their target customers, they needed to know who their target audience is and what they most want to read about. </p><br>
	 				
	 				<li>Solution</li>
	 				<p>To help, Heng built personas across key verticals as well as with product managers for offer solutions. The information on personas coupled with various digital tools enabled a content writer to pitch the content and write about topics of high interest to our chosen audience. To accomplish this, Heng helped facilitate discussions about customers with Global Business Development Managers to define the project vision, personas, and prioritize customer goals. </p><br>
	 				<li>Results</li>
	 				
	 				<p>The biggest impact of the project was the ability to generate unique insights and provide an unorthodox platform for collaboration between sales and marketing to embrace digital with the goal of serving customers. This led to record post awareness and engagement (9k impressions at 6% engagement rate & 5% CTR), achieving 20% follower growth, increased targeting effectiveness shown through increased footprint and engagement of target customer groups in LinkedIn analytics. Later, the personas were also used to redesign various email newsletters to increase engagement scores i.e. achieved average CTR 13%, average read time 5 minutes, average newsletter completion rate of 85%.</p><br>
